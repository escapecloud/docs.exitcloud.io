# Resource Inventory

The Resource Inventory provides a structured overview of the cloud services and resources detected during the assessment.

It answers the question:

> What cloud services are currently in use?

**What you will see**

The Resource Inventory is presented as:
- a list of used cloud services
- aggregated resource counts per service
- used locations

Resources are grouped by service rather than listed individually. This keeps the focus on **architecture and dependency patterns**, not raw infrastructure details.

**Why it matters**

Understanding your resource landscape is the foundation of any cloud exit strategy.

The Resource Inventory helps you:
- identify services with high dependency or usage
- understand platform-specific service adoption
- estimate the complexity of a potential exit

This section is especially important when comparing different exit strategies or tracking changes over time.
