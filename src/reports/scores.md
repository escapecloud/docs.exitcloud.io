# Scores

Scorings provide a quantitative view of cloud exit readiness.

They are available only from **Standard** package.

**What is scored**

Scoring evaluates readiness across multiple dimensions, such as:
- overall exit readiness
- vendor lock-in exposure
- technical, operational, and human factors (where applicable)

Scores are presented visually to support comparison and trend analysis.

**How to use scores**

Scores help you:
- benchmark readiness across assessments
- track improvement over time (for continuous assessments)
- support data-driven decision-making

Scoring is not a pass/fail metric — it is a decision-support tool.
