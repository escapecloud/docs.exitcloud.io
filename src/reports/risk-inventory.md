# Risk Inventory

The Risk Inventory highlights risks that may impact a cloud exit and categorizes them by severity.

It answers the question:

> Where are the main blockers, dependencies, and constraints — and how severe are they?

**What you will see**

Risks are typically presented as:
- a severity breakdown (High / Medium / Low)
- a list of identified risks with descriptions
- impacted services or resource groups (when available)

Each risk represents a potential obstacle to executing the selected exit strategy.

**Why it matters**

The Risk Inventory helps you:
- identify exit blockers early
- prioritize remediation and mitigation efforts
- align technical and business stakeholders on key constraints

This section is central to readiness scoring and strategic decision-making.
