# Cost Overview

The Cost Overview summarizes cloud spending based on aggregated billing data.

It answers the question:

> How much does the current cloud footprint cost, and how is spending distributed over time?

**What you will see**

The Cost Overview typically includes:
- total cloud cost over the last 6 months
- monthly cost breakdown
- cost trends over time

Costs are shown as **aggregated values**, not individual billing line items.

**Why it matters**

Cost is a critical factor in cloud exit planning.

The Cost Overview helps you:
- understand financial exposure to the current provider
- identify cost trends that may impact exit timing
- support business cases for repatriation, hybrid, or migration strategies

Cost data is used as an input for risk evaluation and scoring (where applicable).
