# Alternative Technologies

The Alternative Technologies section explores replacement options for cloud-native services used in your landscape.

It answers the question:

> If we exit this cloud provider, what viable alternatives exist?

**What you will see**

Alternative technologies are presented as:
- mapped alternatives per cloud service
- categorized by function (compute, storage, networking, DevOps, etc.)
- vendor-neutral options where possible

The focus is on **availability and feasibility**, not vendor promotion.

**Why it matters**

Cloud exit is rarely about infrastructure alone — tooling and platforms matter.

This section helps you:
- understand where alternatives exist or are limited
- identify services with strong vendor lock-in
- support technology selection during exit planning

Alternative availability directly influences risk levels and exit readiness scores.
