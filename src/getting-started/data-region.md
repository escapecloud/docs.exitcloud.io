# Data Region

exitcloud.io supports **regional data residency** to help meet performance and regulatory requirements.

You select a data region **before signing in or creating an account**.  
All assessment data, reports, and metadata are stored and processed **exclusively within the selected region**.

**How it works**

- The data region is selected on the **login page**
- The selected region determines **where your account is created**
- All future assessments and reports remain in that region

Once selected, the data region **cannot be changed** for that account.

If you are unsure which region to choose, select the region where your assessment data is legally required to reside.
