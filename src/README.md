# exitcloud.io (EscapeCloud Light)

Welcome to the documentation for exitcloud.io - the **Lightweight Cloud Exit Readiness Platform** for MSPs and SMEs.

These documentation pages explain:
- what **cloud exit readiness** means,
- why it matters for organizations relying on cloud services, and
- how **exitcloud.io** helps assess and manage cloud exit risks in a **structured, repeatable** way.

exitcloud.io focuses on **visibility, risk awareness, and informed decision-making**, without requiring intrusive access to cloud environments.

If you are looking for documentation about the open-source CLI tool, see the [cloudexit](https://github.com/escapecloud/cloudexit/) documentation instead.
