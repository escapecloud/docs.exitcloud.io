# What is Cloud Exit Readiness?

Cloud Exit Readiness describes an organization’s ability to understand, plan, and execute an exit from a cloud service provider if required.

It focuses on answering practical questions such as:
- Which cloud services are currently in use?
- Where do portability constraints and dependencies exist?
- What risks and blockers would impact an exit scenario?
- Which alternative technologies are realistically available?

Cloud Exit Readiness is **not** about performing a migration.
It is about being prepared to make informed decisions if circumstances change.
