# Why Cloud Exit Readiness Matters?

Organizations increasingly rely on cloud services for critical workloads. Over time, this often leads to deep technical, operational, and commercial dependencies.

Cloud Exit Readiness matters because:
- regulatory requirements may change
- vendor pricing and commercial terms may evolve
- geopolitical or data residency constraints may arise
- long-term vendor lock-in can limit strategic flexibility

Without visibility into exit risks, organizations are forced to react under pressure.

Cloud Exit Readiness enables proactive risk management instead of reactive crisis handling.
